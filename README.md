Interactive Microsimulation Dashboard

The Sick-Sicker model is a 4 state (Healthy, Sick, Sicker or Dead) Markov model. The cohort progresses through the model in cycles of equal duration, with the proportion of those in each health state in the next cycle being dependant on the proportion in each health state in the current cycle and the transition probability matrix.

With this dashboard users can customize model parameters including transition probabilities, state-specific costs, state-specific utilities, time horizon, discount rates, cohort size among others. The dashboard runs a microsimulation based on user input and provides intuitive visualizations making it a powerful tool for health economic evaluation and scenario analysis.
